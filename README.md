# cs-mines-lobos-a-2022

These are all the programs I wrote for the CS@Mines 2022 Competition (Advanced Division).  I have comments at the top saying if they worked or not.

There are also some programs my teammates wrote that are not on this repo (yet).

The competition link is: https://mines22advanced.kattis.com/
